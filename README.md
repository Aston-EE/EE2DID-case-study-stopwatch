# EE2DID-practical

A repository of the practical templates a solutions for intermediate design

The repositories has separate branches for legacy versions for 2021 and 202, template and solutions.

The coursework is made up of an initial introductory set of exercises which don't change from year to year followed by a case study which does.
These will have branches

    main
    introduction
        |---------introduction-solution
    dicegame
        |---------dicegame-solution
    traffic-lights
        |---------traffic-lights-solution
    vending-machine
        |---------vending-machine-solution
    stopwatch
        |---------stopwatch-solution

The coursework for a specific year should be a merge of the introduction and the case study into a new branch
